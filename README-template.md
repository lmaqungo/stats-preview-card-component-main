## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the toughest of the projects I've done on frontendmentors. I struggled immensely with alignment with flexbox, as well as working witht the media queries. I struggled with making the purple colour overlay to the point I quit entirely. I learnt more about flexbox in the process. It took me over two days, with procrastination to complete this.

### Continued development

Css transitions and animations, css flexbox, maybe dip my feet into grid
